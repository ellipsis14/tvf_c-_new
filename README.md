Source Code for the IPDG methods for total variation flow. We consider the numerical solution of the regularized fourth order total variation flow problem based on an implicit discretization in time and a C$^0$ Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (C$^0$IPDG) method in space. In particular, It is shown that at each time instant the C$^0$IPDG approximation represents the necessary and sufficient optimality condition for the minimization of an associated proper convex, coercive, and lower semicontinuous objective functional. This repository is for the recent paper published recently by NMPDE.
